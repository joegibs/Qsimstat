# To Do List 

### To do list for things which need to be done and implemented. In rough order of importance, though anything is helpful, don't take it too strict. 

1. Is my SRE, and SFF, consistent?
2. Sometimes it seems my states do not work/statistics are zero. Why is this? I am pruning those right now, slightly, but I'm still unsure exactly why it is happening. 
3. Make graphing functions from the saved data. Do results seem resonable? Suprising? 
4. Implement Clifford + T with flexible number of T injected, and Matchgate + Swap with flexible number of swaps
5. Implement 2D Shallow Circuits, and Dicke States 
6. Implement Free Fermion in Disguise Hamiltonians, and random 2-local Hamiltonians (ask me for code which may be helpful)
7. Is there an interesting experiment with MERA? 

###### For now, this is the list!
